  <h2>The Security</h2>

  <p>La Li Lu Le Lo is an end to end encrypted messaging service that keeps all messages
  hidden, not only from outside parties but the host server and anyone with access to
  the database.</p>

  <p>The encryption scheme works as follows:</p>

  <p>First, when you sign up, a public and private
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)" target="_blank">RSA</a>
  key-pair are generated using the
  <a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge" target="_blank">node-forge</a>
  encryption package. The public key is saved to the database as is but your private key
  is itself encrypted using your password as the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard" target="blank">AES</a>
  key and is then stored in the database. When you sign in after that, the private key
  is decrypted using your password and ready to use throughout the rest of the app.</p>
  <p>Next, when a conversation is created, all messages are encrypted using a
  pseudorandomly generated AES key. This key is then encrypted using each participant
  in the conversation's public RSA key, so each user has a unique encrypted AES key.</p>
  <p>Finally, when you send messages in a conversation, it decrypts your version of
  the AES key and then encrypts and decrypts all messages using that AES key. This way
  we can take advantage of the speed and convenience of a single AES key but still
  keep that key completely hidden.</p>

  <h2>The Function</h2>

  <p>In addition to being secure, La Li Lu Le Lo also has many of the features
  expected from a proprietary messaging service. Using the
  <a href="https://github.com/twitter/twemoji">twemoji</a> package, La Li Lu Le Lo has
  full support for emojis. It also allows for media, images and videos including the webm,
  mp4, jpg, png and gif formats, to be shared through the service.</p>

  <h3>Commands</h3>

  <p>La Li Lu Le Lo has several commands that allow you to embed media, take polls and
  generate random numbers for fun.</p>

  <p><strong>!img &lt;image url&gt;</strong> will allow you to embed external images.</p>

  <p><strong>!webm &lt;webm url&gt;</strong> will allow you to embed external webms.</p>

  <p><strong>!youtube &lt;youtube url&gt;</strong> will allow you to embed external youtube videos.</p>

  <p><strong>!poll &lt;question&gt;|&lt;answer1&gt;|&lt;answer2&gt;|&lt;answer3&gt;...</strong>
  will allow you to take a poll with any number of answers that anyone in the conversation can answer.
  The question and answer choices to this poll are also encrypted so only those in the conversation will
  ever know the contents.</p>

  <p><strong>!roll &lt;maximum&gt;</strong> will generate a number between 1 and the maximum number and send it to the chat.</p>

  <h2>The Message Behind The Messaging</h2>

  <p>I started this project because many of my friends and I primarily use Facebook
  messenger to communicate but I always disliked it because of the numerous
  privacy violations and potential free speech concerns but couldn't offer a
  <em>LIBRE</em> alternative. And thus the app was born. With the encryption in place
  and guarantees of transparency made possible by the GPL 2, I know this app can be a
  tool for freedom of speech and data privacy. I hope that people find it not only good
  in terms of security and ethics, but also in terms of quality and usability.</p>
